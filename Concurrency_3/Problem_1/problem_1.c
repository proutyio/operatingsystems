// Consider a sharable resource with the following characteristics:
// As long as there are fewer than three processes using the resource, new processes can start using it right away.
// Once there are three processes using the resource, all three must leave before any new processes can begin using it.
// Implement a mutual exclusion solution that meets the above constraints.
